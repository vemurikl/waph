## Front-end Web Development with a Professional Profile Website on github.io cloud service

## Overview and Requirements 

In this project, you will expand front-end web development skills by developing a Professional Profile Website and deploying it on `github.io` cloud service. This project has general, non-technical, and technical requirements with grade distributions as follows.

### General requirements (30 pts): 

+ Create and deploy a personal website on GitHub cloud (github.io) as a professional profile with your resume, including your name, headshot, contact information, background, e.g., education, your experiences and skills (25 pts).
 ​
+ Create a link to a new HTML page to introduce this "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and related hands-on projects (5 pts)
 ​
### Non-technical requirements (20 pts)​

+ Use an open-source CSS template or framework such as Bootstrap​

_Target this profile for your potential employer, and your page will be graded as a part of your job application​_

+ Include a page tracker, for example: [https://analytics](https://analytics.withgoogle.com/)](https://analytics.withgoogle.com/), [https://flagcounter.com/](https://flagcounter.com/).

### Technical requirements (50 pts)​

#### Basic JavaScript code (20 pts)​

+ Two public Web APIs integration (20 pts)​

1. Integrate the jokeAPI ([https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any), similar to Lab 2.2.d.i) with Any category of joke to display a new joke in your page every 1 minute

2. Integrate a public API with graphics. Examples: [https://xkcd.com/info.0.json](https://xkcd.com/info.0.json), [https://www.weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io).

## Report

You can write a report using Markdown format or any Word processor, i.e., you do not need to use Markdown to write your report. Your report should follow the template/outline provided in Lecture 2 ([https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph/blob/main/README-template.md](https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph/blob/main/README-template.md)) which should include the course name and instructor, your name and email together with your headshot (150x150 pixels), and sub-sections of the assignment's overview, and each task and sub-task.

There should be an overview sub-section where you must write an overview of the assignment and the outcomes you learned from it. Include your website's clickable URL deployed on `github.io`. Also, include a direct clickable link to the project folder on GitHub.com so that it can be viewed when grading, for example, [https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph-phungph/tree/main/individual-project1](https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph-phungph/tree/main/individual-project1).

For each sub-task, write a brief summary of how you complete it. You are welcome to include code snippets and screenshots to demonstrate the outcome, however, they are not required. **Please note that demo screenshots must include your virtual machine name or your name with proper captions and be visible, i.e., in high resolution, not too blurry or with much blank space, for grading**. 

Your report must be exported in  PDF with contents and screenshots are correctly rendered in proper order. The PDF file should be named `your-username-waph-project1.pdf`, e.g., `phungph-waph-project1.pdf`, and uploaded to Canvas to submit by the deadline. 


## Deliverables and Submission

You need to submit **three** deliverables in PDF files for grading:

+ Your report mentioned above.

+ Your deployed website printed from a browser in PDF.
